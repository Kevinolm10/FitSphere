## Design Principles

The design of **FitSphere** follows modern design principles, with a strong focus on **simplicity** and **usability**. By adhering to the *Material Design* guidelines, we ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. The layout is crafted to be minimalistic, yet meaningful, without unnecessary distractions. Every design element is selected to enhance the user experience, ensuring that functionality is never compromised by aesthetics.

To create a clean and uncluttered experience, we emphasize **white space**, which not only adds visual appeal but also helps guide the user's attention to key areas. Given the multifunctionality of the platform, white space helps separate different components, making interactions more efficient and enjoyable.

### Color Scheme

The color palette of **FitSphere** is carefully curated to balance boldness with elegance. The primary color of the platform is `#333333` for the background, creating a sleek, modern feel. Accents of `#FF5733` bring energy and vibrancy to buttons, highlights, and key action items. Additionally, `#1a73e8` is used for buttons, offering a cool contrast that complements the warmer accent color and enhances the overall visual flow.

![Color Scheme](documentation/design/color_palete.png)
Here’s a closer look at the color scheme:

- **Background**: The background color of the application is set to `#333333`, creating a deep, dark environment that allows the content to stand out. This rich, dark tone exudes sophistication and is easy on the eyes for long viewing sessions.
- **Accent Color**: The vibrant `#FF5733` is used throughout the platform as an accent color. It draws attention to important elements like calls to action, links, and notifications, providing a strong contrast to the background and enhancing the overall visual appeal.
- **Buttons**: Buttons across the site are styled with `#1a73e8`, a calm yet impactful shade of blue. This color is used for key actions like form submissions, login buttons, and navigation elements, ensuring they stand out while maintaining a balanced look.
- **Footer**: The footer area is designed in `#333333` with **white** text, creating a clean and professional look that complements the overall design.

By combining these elements, **FitSphere** ensures a modern, functional, and visually pleasing experience for its users.


### Typography

For **FitSphere**, we have selected the **Oswald** font to ensure a modern, bold, and clean aesthetic throughout the application. Oswald’s distinctive and clear character design enhances readability and supports the overall user experience, making content easy to consume. The font choice complements our minimalist design and pairs well with the application’s color scheme.

Here’s a quick look at different weights of the **Oswald** font:

- **Regular (400 weight)**: The base weight for standard text, ensuring readability without distraction.
  
  ![Typography](documentation/design/oswald_400.png)

- **Medium (700 weight)**: Used to emphasize important elements, such as buttons or headings, providing a stronger visual hierarchy.

  ![Typography](documentation/design/oswald_700.png)

- **Bold (900 weight)**: Used for key emphasis, making certain elements stand out, such as titles, subheadings, and critical call-to-actions.

  ![Typography](documentation/design/oswald_900.png)

To highlight the most important content, the font weight is set to **900**. For action-oriented items like buttons, the weight is **700** to give them prominence. For the rest of the text, a **400** weight is used to maintain balance and ensure a clean, easy-to-read experience for the user.

By using **Oswald**, we create a cohesive and visually appealing typography style that enhances user interaction and strengthens the overall design of **FitSphere**.

## Flowcharts

This application is designed to cater to users with varying roles, each fulfilling different expectations and accessing specific functionalities. To help visualize how the entire system works and how the different roles interact with it, we have created a comprehensive **website functionality flowchart**.

This flowchart serves as a high-level overview of how the entire website functions, starting from the user’s initial interaction with the platform to navigating through the various sections. It outlines the core user journeys and how different elements of the system interconnect, ensuring all users, regardless of their role, can easily understand the flow of actions within the platform.

The flowchart was created using [Draw.io](https://www.lucidchart.com/), providing a clean, easy-to-understand representation of the website’s structure and user experience. 

- [Website Functionality Flowchart](documentation/flowcharts/flowchart_website_functionality.pdf)

This flowchart includes:

- **Homepage Access**: Where users first interact with the site, whether they are logging in, signing up, or simply browsing.
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: After logging in, users are redirected to dashboards tailored to their roles (e.g., admin, user, trainer, etc.).
- **Navigation**: How users can navigate between different sections, such as profile management, feedback submission, and the main features of the platform.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Illustrates how users can interact with trainers and leave feedback, which is central to the user experience.

This flowchart is intended to give a clear picture of the core processes that drive the platform and how users can seamlessly interact with different features based on their role.

Each flowchart is designed to provide clarity on the user’s journey, ensuring all stakeholders understand the processes that guide interactions with the system.
