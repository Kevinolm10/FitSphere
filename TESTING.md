## Bugs

### Known bugs

- Whitenoise does not collect static for me which has resulted in me having collect static files manually every time i want to deploy. 

- Some buttons and functionality on the site sometimes loses css and i have not found a solution for this, could be related to the static files not being collected properly.

- Some parts of the website sometimes loses "connection" or the view itself when debug is set to false.

### Solved bugs

- The whitenoise bug can be considered mostly solved since i am collecting the static files manually.

- Solved a bug where the views for saving a comment would not register. I made the view and form less complicated and made it more quality and it now works.

- multiple css bugs regarding bootstrap and hidden html elements which i have found through the developer console > application > thefile.html and could edit it through there.
